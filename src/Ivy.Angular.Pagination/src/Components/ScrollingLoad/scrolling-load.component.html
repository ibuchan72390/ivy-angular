<!--  

    The idea here is that this is a fixed height div with scrolling overflow.
    As we scroll to the bottom of the div, we'll increase the page size and emit the new paging request.
    When the higher context receives the response, they'll simply add them to a rendering ngFor.
    This will increase the height of the div allowing for further scrolling

<div [style.max-height]="getHeight() | async" 
     style="overflow-y: scroll; height: 100%;"
     class="full-width"
     #scrollcontainer
     (scroll)="onScroll($event)">

    <div #scrollcontent>
        <ng-content></ng-content>
    </div>

</div>
